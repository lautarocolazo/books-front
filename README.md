# Overview

I learned TypeScript by the first time ever. I tried to implement in something similar to a full-stack experience so I used it with NodeJs, Express, and Svelte.

The application that I built is a REST API in the backend with a front-end to add books and organize them by genres, and display some information like author, pages, etc.

The main purpose of writing this software was to be able to organize the books that I read.
